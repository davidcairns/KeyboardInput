# KeyboardInput (TODO: Rename, like, duh)
Check out `VimCommands.swift`, build & run the application, open up Terminal in the background, try out the commands for yourself. The app’s window has to be in the foreground to catch the keys (TODO: Fix this if possible, duh). You can type the commands manually like a caveman, or turn on voice dictation (or use something like Dragon for Mac).

Add some new commands! Please send me merge requests, I love them!

# KeyboardInput (TODO: Rename, like, duh)
Check out `VimCommands.swift`, build & run the application, open up Terminal in the background, try out the commands for yourself. Add some new ones! Please send me merge requests, I love them!

Inspired by [Tavis Rudd](https://github.com/tavisrudd)â€™s [talks](https://www.infoq.com/presentations/Programming-Voice/) on coding by voice.
